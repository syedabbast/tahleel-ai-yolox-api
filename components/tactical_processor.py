"""
Tactical Processor Module - TAHLEEL.ai Football Tactical Analysis

Purpose:
- Convert YOLOX detections + frame metadata into actionable tactical JSON
- Detect formations (e.g., 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1) with â‰¥80% confidence
- Identify weaknesses (errors, turnovers, marking issues) with evidence
- Analyze player movement patterns, heatmaps, key behaviors
- Map player positions to zones (12 pitch zones)
- Generate tactical recommendations for coaches
- Save results to BOTH Google Cloud Storage AND Supabase

Business context:
- NO MOCK DATA: Only real detections and analysis
- Must generate enterprise-grade insights for Arab League clients

Dependencies:
- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
